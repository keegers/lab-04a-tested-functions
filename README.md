# First Lab with Tests

-----
## Stuff Used
- first time using ES lint
- first time using Qunit for testing

-----
## Tips Learned
- make sure to always set a negative test first to make sure you're not getting FALSE POSITIVES
- reminder to check whether test is inclusive or non-inclusive

-----
## If Continued, Would Follow Up On
- functions that are passed functions (what does that mean for scope, parameters, execution etc.)
